# Exercise 1.1

## Exercise 1.1.1: What is the difference between compiler and interpreter

* compiler: compiler turn a source language into the executable format by machine
* interpreter: interpreter run the source language and input to produce output



## Exercise 1.1.2: What are the advantage of (a) a compiler over interpreter (b) an interpreter over a compiler

1. Compiler is usually much faster than interpreter. It can be more efficient.
2. Interpreter is hardware independent. It can copy through internet.



## Exercise 1.1.3: What advantages are there to a language-processing system in which compiler produces assembly language rather than machine language

assembly language is much more human friendly. It can be better debugged.



## Exercise 1.1.4: A compiler that translates a high-level language into another high-level language is called a source-to-source translator. What advantages are there to using C as a target language for a compiler?

C is a high-level language supported by various hardware platform. Translate into C so the high-level language can run on various platform. On the other hand, C has plenty of debug tools. It can help program to debug the program.



## Exercise 1.1.5: Describe some of the tasks that an assembler needs to perform.

1. Turn assembly language into machine code
2. Allocate space in object file
